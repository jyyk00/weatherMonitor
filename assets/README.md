# Unit 06 Server-Side APIs Homework: Weather Dashboard
This app is a weather dashboard application with search functionality to find current weather conditions and the future weather outlook for multiple cities all around the world.
When the user first opens the application the user will be greeted with the curent Date.
The user will need to enter the name of the city they would like to search for or click on a past search option then click on the search icon. 
The user will then be introduced to a 5 day forcast (text does not align with actual date and true outcome of the function) as well as the current low/high temp., humidity, windspeed, and "Today's weather".
